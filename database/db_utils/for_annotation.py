operations_prompt = """Given the previous state and current utterance, first predict whether the dialogue is carried over from the prior turn.
Next, predict the aggregation type. The aggregation represents what final SQL function is applied to the key column.
It must start with sum, count, average, min, max, top, bottom, std_dev, median, percentile, or all.
If the utterance mentions the best or worst of a single item, the aggregation will be 'max' or 'min', respectively.
On the other hand, if best or worst does not have an associated value, assume the aggregation is 'top 7' or 'bottom 7', respectively.
If no aggregation function is applied, then return 'all' which is the equivalent of a SELECT *

Finally, predict any operations that are applied: filter, group, sort.
filter - limiting the rows returned to match a criteria or range of values
sort - sorting a column to establish order or ranking, frequently to find top values
group - segmenting or grouping the data in some fashion, including pivot tables
none - means the utterance does not fit into any combination of the above three options
Predict 'none' when there are no operations. Otherwise, your response should be a series of short phrases starting with either 'filter', 'group', or 'sort'

* Choosing from the existing columns, what columns from these tables are being used or updated? Connect the different tables by a semicolon. If it is unclear what columns to use, output 'unsure.'
* If there is uncertainty in the table or columns, write a clarifying question that would help resolve the ambiguity. If there is no ambiguity, put 'N/A'.

Pay attention to the previous dialogue state, which includes the prior agent utterance, since the current user utterance may be referring to a previous request.
Think step by step, and take into account the dialogue history. You can sometimes infer ambiguous tables and columns from the history.

Previous state: None
User utterance: How much money did we make between April and June?

* Ambiguity: N/A

Previous state: None

Thought: The orders table has a channels column. However, the question is underspecified. If we are looking at order volume, we just need the channels column.
