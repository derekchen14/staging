  <h1>Providing useful, reliable, and trustworthy assistants to enable people to do their best work.</h1>
  <b2>
    In order to develop a robust and reliable assistant, we train specialized models using proprietary datasets 
    that have been collected specifically for the purposes of improving analytics capabilities. Our agent is 
    significantly better at business intelligence because it has been explicitly taught to be better. Full control 
    of the system means our agent also operates faster and with more openness of what is going on behind the scenes.
